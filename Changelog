  0.3 July 2008 - NON CPAN RELEASE
    - Change mime type detection to just use the file extension of the file 
      being served from local disk (rather than magic). Windows doesn't have
      a magic file...

  0.2 July 2008 - NON CPAN RELEASE
    - Fixed t/03_pod_coverage.t - I'd ripped this off from another one of my modules, and it still had references to that module,
      and therefore didn't work without this module installed.
    - Added relevant requires, so that the HTTP::Proxy::Engine classes get
      bundled with the script.
    - Change packing instructions so that we don't pack just the .par

  0.1 July 2008 - NON CPAN RELEASE
    - Initial version
