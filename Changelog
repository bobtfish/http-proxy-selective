  - Change mime type detection to just use the file extension of the file 
    being served from local disk (rather than magic). Windows doesn't have
    a magic file...

0.2 July 2008
  - Fixed t/03_pod_coverage.t - I'd ripped this off from another one of my modules, and it still had references to that module,
    and therefore didn't work without this module installed.
  - Added relevant requires, so that the HTTP::Proxy::Engine classes get
    bundled with the script.
  - Change packing instructions so that we don't pack just the .par
