Possible enhancements not covered in the Venda contract:

 . Use File::HomeDir so that you can configure paths relative to your user's 
   home directory.
 . Enable config paths relative to current directory.
 . Have a standard 'dot file' location to store config, so that regular users
   can just invoke selective_proxy
 . Have 'if you can't find it locally, serve it from remote' type of path/
   mode of operation (as opposed to the current 404 behavior). Could be useful 
   sometimes.
 . Make Module::Install::PAR be able to generate make targets which make 
   executables for scripts.
